# RGB_CIEXYY_Laser_Converter
Converts RGB to a format in terms of 650nm red, 532nm green, and 473nm blue. These are relatively inexpensive, commercially accessible lasers.

This project was made to try to find a more universally reproducible approach to visible light. Unlike traditional RGB, the red, green, and blue are produced from a material with a known electromagnetic frequency. Red at 650nm using GaInP/AlGaInP. Green at 532nm using Nd:Y3Al5O12. And Blue at 473nm using InGaN (though, I may change to 450 or 460nm in the future).

Each laser should be at equal distance as well as equal power. The output of percentages is the power level percentage each respective laser should be to produce the desired RGB equivalent that was input.
